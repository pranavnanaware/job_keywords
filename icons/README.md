# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (used in extension list)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (used in management page)  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (used in Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

All icons should:
- Be in PNG format
- Have a transparent background
- Represent the Job Keywords Optimizer concept (e.g., resume, keywords, optimization)
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders.
The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.

## Suggested Design

Consider an icon that combines:
- Document/resume symbol
- Keywords or text elements  
- Optimization arrows or check marks
- Professional color scheme (blues, greens)
