Icon Files Needed:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editing software or online icon generators.
Recommended design: A magnifying glass with document/resume symbol, or target/bullseye icon.

For quick testing, you can:
1. Create simple PNG files with the required dimensions
2. Use any existing PNG files and rename them
3. Download free icons from sites like flaticon.com or icons8.com

The extension will work without these icons, but they improve the user experience.
